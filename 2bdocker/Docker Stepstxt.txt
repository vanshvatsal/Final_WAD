Hello Friends, In this video I have explained about Laboratory Practice-II Web Application Development Assignment-2(B).Problem Statement: Create Docker Container Environment (NVIDEIA Docker or any other).** Links:Visual Studio Code Download Link : https://bit.ly/3Nzh6RDDocker Desktop (For Windows 10+ 64-bit) Download Link : https://dockr.ly/38BQNLTDocker Toolbox (For Windows 7 or earlier 32-bit) Download Link : https://bit.ly/3lwZxpcNode.js (Needs windows 8.1+ version) Download Link : https://bit.ly/3ailfen** Steps to implement this assignment: - Basic Requirements:  1. Install Docker for Desktop/ Docker Toolbox as per your system support from below link.     Docker Desktop (For Windows 10+ 64-bit) Download Link : https://dockr.ly/38BQNLT    Docker Toolbox (For Windows 7 or earlier 32-bit) Download Link : https://bit.ly/3lwZxpc  2. Install Nodejs from below link.    https://bit.ly/3ailfen  3. Add docker (from microsoft) extension in VS Code. -Steps to Implement the Assignment:  Step-1: Create a folder (Note: Folder name should be in lowercase).    Let the folder name be: partb  Step-2: Create any file with any extension( such as .js, .txt, .py, etc....) in the same above folder(Here, partb) and write some content in the file.   Let the file name be: yogesh.js  The file contains the following code:  console.log("Name: Yogesh Borhade");  console.log("Class: TE");  console.log("Subject: LP-II Web Application Development");  console.log("We are implementing Assignment-2B");  Step-3: Create file in the same folder with file name as- Dockerfile and press enter key. (Note: Don't add any file extension after the file name)  File: Dockerfile      Step-4: Write following code in Dockerfile (Created in Step-3) and save it.:  FROM node: alpine  COPY . /partb  CMD node /partb/yogesh.js  Step-5: Open terminal in VS Code and type the following command:  docker --version  We will see the version of your docker if it is installed successfully.   Step-6: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:  node yogesh.js  It will display the contents in your file which is created in Step-2.  Step-7: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:  docker build -t partb .   We will see that it is successfully built.   Step-8: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:  docker images  You will see the docker images with REPOSITORY, TAG, IMAGE ID, CREATED (Time), SIZE.** Some Basic Questions That Can Be Asked: 1.
